/*The reason I chose to write this story in this flowchart and code in JavaScript was because I find that health 
is very important to a lot people now a days especially when it comes to physique and appearance you need your 
regular supplements. I for one enjoy drinking protein shakes because itâ€™s a great meal replacement and very useful
after your daily workout. You can make a protein shake either before or after an exercise. It has really helped 
me out so much throughout the years to strengthen and build muscle for injuries that I sustain while I was 
deployed to Iraq when I was in the military years ago.  You can always make a protein shake on the go and can 
also be very good for you as long as you are working out.*/
