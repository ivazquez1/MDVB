<p>The reason I chose to write this story is because I find that health is very important to a lot people now a 
days especially when it comes to physique and appearance you need your regular supplements. I for one enjoy 
drinking protein shakes because itâ€™s a great meal replacement and very useful after your daily workout. You 
can make a protein shake either before or after an exercise. It has really helped me out so much throughout 
the years to strengthen and build muscle for injuries that I sustain while I was deployed to Iraq when I was 
in the military years ago.  You can always make a protein shake on the go and can also be very good for you 
as long as you are working out. I will explain in code on how to make a protein shake step by step.</p>
